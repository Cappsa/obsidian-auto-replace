# Auto Replace Plugin for Obsidian

A powerful and flexible tool that automatically replaces text abbreviations as you type. Designed to save time when writing extensive notes, documentation, or study materials.

## Features

* **Instant Auto-Replace:** Type your abbreviation, hit space or any punctuation mark, and it instantly expands into the full text.
* **Folder-Specific Rules:** Create abbreviations that only work within specific folders. The same short word can mean different things depending on the context of your notes.
* **Manual Mode:** Don't want a word to expand automatically? Set it to "Manual" and expand it only when you want using a customizable hotkey ("Replace manual abbreviations in current note").
* **Safe Cursor Handling:** The plugin intelligently replaces text without causing your cursor to jump around, even during manual bulk replacements.
* **Draft Settings:** Edit your rules in a clean, organized table. Changes are only applied when you click "Save", preventing accidental deletions.

## How to Use

1. Go to Community Plugins and install **Auto Replace**.
2. Enable the plugin.
3. Go to settings and add your first abbreviation (e.g., Abbr: `ASAP`, Expanded: `As soon as possible`).
4. (Optional) Specify a folder path if you want to limit the rule to a specific directory.
5. Type `ASAP ` in your note and watch it expand!
